# Playwright Autotests Portfolio

## About the Project
This project is a portfolio showcasing automated tests written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and `pytest`. 
Playwright is a modern tool for end-to-end testing of web applications, supporting multiple browsers.
The tests in this project are organized using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which helps to separate the test logic from the web page structure. This approach improves the maintainability and readability of the tests, as each page of the web application is represented by a separate class with methods that interact with its elements.

## Technologies Used
- **Playwright** - for browser automation
- **Python** - programming language for writing tests
- **pytest** - testing framework
- **Allure Report** - test report generation (optional)

## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VladyslavKlevanskyi/magento-ui-testing-pw.git
cd magento-ui-testing-pw
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests
### Run all tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Run a specific test
```bash
pytest test/test_create_account.py
pytest test/test_eco_friendly.py
pytest test/test_sale.py
```

### Run tests with Allure report (if used)
```bash
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
allure serve allure-results
```
